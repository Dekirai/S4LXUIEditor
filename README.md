# Usage
1. Fully extract the game using a resource tool (Or just the resources folder)
2. Start `XUIEditor.exe`
3. Click `Load Folder` and select the `resources` directory
4. All `.xui` files should be loaded now

6. A new window opens, now you can easily edit it

- You can control the elements by using the arrow keys, drag and drop or manually edit the values
